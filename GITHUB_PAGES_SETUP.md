# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## ✅ Code is Ready!

All your gallery images and website code have been pushed to GitHub successfully!

## 🚀 Enable GitHub Pages (Required)

You need to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:

### Steps:

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/jobs-shield/the-eagle-fitness

2. **Click on "Settings"** (top menu bar)

3. **Click on "Pages"** (left sidebar under "Code and automation")

4. **Under "Build and deployment"**:
   - **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - (NOT "Deploy from a branch")

5. **Save** and wait for the deployment

6. **Check the Actions tab** to see the deployment progress:
   - https://github.com/jobs-shield/the-eagle-fitness/actions

7. Once deployed, your site will be live at:
   - **https://jobs-shield.github.io/the-eagle-fitness/**

## 🎯 What's Included

✅ All 15 gallery images
✅ Complete website (Home, About, Trainers, Membership, Gallery, Contact)
✅ Responsive design
✅ GitHub Actions deployment workflow
✅ .nojekyll file for proper asset loading

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If the site shows a blank page:
1. Make sure GitHub Pages is set to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
2. Check the Actions tab for any deployment errors
3. Wait 2-3 minutes after the action completes for DNS propagation

## 📝 Note

The gallery images work perfectly on localhost. The GitHub Pages deployment will work once you enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings following the steps above.
